            <h3>who we are</h3>
            <p> We are a group of passionate technologists who work for the State of Tennessee.  Our mission is to promote the development of quality software throughout the state, with the understanding that what we do is in support of our fellow employees and our fellow citizens.  </p>
            <p> We are open to anyone who works for the State of Tennessee - either as a full-time employee or as a contractor - and is interested in creating high-quality software.  </p>
            <p> Our group is still in its infancy and we need your help to grow.  Interested in joining us?  Send us an <a href="mailto:tngovnerds@gmail.com">email</a>.  </p>

          <article id="why">
            <h3>why this group</h3>
            <p> We strongly believe that, individually, the vast majority of software professionals who work for the State of Tennessee are smart, eager and passionate about the work they do.  However, traditionally, there has been no good way for these individuals to meet, to network and to learn from one another. We believe that by working together, we can improve as individuals and we can help move Tennessee forward.
